# Telegraf Execd Toolkit

This library is a set of useful tools for quickly building a telegraf
external plugin.  It includes some wrappers around:

* Metric output, in a format that's compatible with telegraf but without a lot
  of boilerplate
* Logging, in a way that's configurable by the user via the command line and
  can feed log messages into telegraf as metrics, or be directed elsewhere
